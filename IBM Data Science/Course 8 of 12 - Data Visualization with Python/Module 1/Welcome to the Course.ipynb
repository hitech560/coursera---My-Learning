Furthermore, you'll explore the process of creating maps using folium and superimposing them with markers to make them interesting. Finally, you'll learn how to create a choropleth map using folium. In module 4, you'll explore the benefits of dashboards and identify the different web-based dashboarding tools in Python. You will learn about plotly and discover how to use plotly graph objects and Plotly express to create charts, you will gain insight into dash and open source user interface, Python library and its two components. Finally, you will clearly understand the callback function and determine how to connect core and HTML components using callback. Finally, module 5, primary focus is helping you complete your final lab assignment. Your objective is to track and report on the performance of domestic flights operated by US airlines. The objective is to analyze the reporting airlines performance to improve flight and customer reliability. After completing this course, you can use different visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, seaborn, and folium, to create expressive visual representations of your data for different purposes. You'll also be able to use basic and advanced visualization tools and identify different web-based dashboarding tools. There is a lot to cover here. To get the most from this course, make sure to view every video, review your knowledge with each quiz, and complete all the hands-on labs. If you have any trouble with the course material, please don't hesitate to contact us and the discussion forum. Thank you for being part of our course We look forward to sharing this valuable knowledge with you\n",

    "The primary focus of this module is to practice the skills gained earlier in the course and then demonstrate those skills in your final assignment. For the final assignment you will analyze historical automobile sales data covering periods of recession and non-recession. You will bring your analysis to life using visualization techniques and then display the plots and graphs on dashboards. Finally, you will submit your assignment for peer review and you will review an assignment from one of your peers. To wrap up the course you will take a final exam in the form of a timed quiz.\n",
